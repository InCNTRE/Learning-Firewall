Here is the pox developers reply(in red) to my question 
 
 Well, your threaded code has the most obvious problem that you are trying to call the thread's .run() in a loop instead of calling .start() which is how you actually start a new thread.  But in general, you're probably better off not writing normal threaded code in POX if you don't have to.  One reason for this is that you have to worry about synchronization, which your example doesn't seem to be doing.

You also don't say what it's really supposed to be doing, and it's kind of hard to tell because a good chunk of the code has been removed.  I am guessing that your firewall is supposed to be taking input (policies) from something else over a socket?  If that's the case, one easy option might be to use the messenger component, which can receive JSON messages from a socket or an HTTP connection and will raise events in response to them (obviously this only works if you get to dictate the communication protocol that's used to communicate with the firewall).

I tried to implement in similar fashion as threading. Can you please point out which part of the code is doing it
